>Pancreatitis is an exploration of the widespread dissonance and confusion uprooted at the turn of the decade. Relief does not exist here and the idea of a normalcy is more of a joke than a comfort. As soon as you start to gain an understanding of the world around you— everything dissolves at once, introducing new information which drastically changes your perception of the world around you. Everything is unstable, and every step risks transporting you to a new and terrifying dimension.

>Inspired by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s “Roadside Picnic,” the video explores internal dissonance within one’s external environment. The viewer goes through five stages, each with its own physical anomalous traits which impair, skew, and diverge from one’s initial understanding of how the world around them can and should behave. The track combines Khahimi Karie’s soft, relaxing tones —whispering to you like a lullaby— with harsh and abrupt production, creating an unfulfilled desire to more deeply understand the lyrics, which is repressed by the onslaught of aggressive instrumentation. Pancreatitis seeks to evoke an awareness of the innate dissonance which comes with trying to understand the world around us.
